# API_Django
API for a Google Keep-esque note-taking web app

## Technologies used

* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/): The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines (Django builds better web apps with less code).
* [TastyPie](https://django-tastypie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Webservice API framework for Django. It provides a convenient, yet powerful and highly customizable, abstraction for creating REST-style interfaces.
## Installation
* If you wish to run your own build, first ensure you have python globally installed in your computer. If not, you can get python [here](https://www.python.org").
* After doing this, confirm that you have installed virtualenv globally as well. If not, run this:
    ```bash
        $ pip install virtualenv
    ```
* Then, Git clone this repo to your PC
    ```bash
        $ git clone [https://github.com/gitgik/django-rest-api.git](https://github.com/JoeyFrancis/API_Django.git)https://github.com/JoeyFrancis/API_Django.git
    ```
